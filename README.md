## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Afer 2 weeks of learning HTML / CSS I've definitely learnt a lot, and looking forward to my continued learning. On this project in particular, I've learnt more about the placement of HTML elements and the accompanying CSS to gain the desired outcome.

### Continued development

Still early in my journey, but am hoping to be able to complete these projects quicker and more easily as time moves on.
